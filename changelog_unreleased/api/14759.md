#### [Breaking] plugin search feature has been removed (#14759 by @fisker)

The plugin auto search feature didn't work well when using pnpm, and cause slowness.

`--plugin-search-dir`, `--no-plugin-search` flags for CLI and `pluginSearchDirs` in API options has been removed in Prettier main.

`--plugin` flag and `plugins` option should be used instead, see [documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/plugins.html#using-plugins).
