#### Fix missing required comma in type parameters (#14688 by @fisker, @sosukesuzuki)

Previously, we only print trailing comma when file extension is `.tsx`, turns out `.mts`, `.cts` files requires it to parse too.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```tsx
// Input
export const unsafeCoerce = <T,>(u: unknown): T => u as T

// Prettier stable
export const unsafeCoerce = <T>(u: unknown): T => u as T;

// Prettier main
export const unsafeCoerce = <T,>(u: unknown): T => u as T;
```
